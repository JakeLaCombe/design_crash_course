					<section>
						<h1>Your Situation</h1>
						<p>So you have an app idea, but need a design</p>
						<br />
						<p>Your coders can't design anything (doesn't expect them too), so it's up to you!</p>
						<br />
						<p>Give it a whirl!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<quote>
							This can't be hard

					<h2>Why and I so terrible?</h2>
					<p>Design is not in the blood as most people think</p>
					<br />
					<p>Being a good designer involves knowing the fundamentals of design.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Coders have standards, and design is the exact same way.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>So what is Design?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Terminology</h2>
						<p>Design is essentially a communication tool for your audience.</p>
						<br />
						<p>You are wanting to tell them something, have them interact with something, and get them to the correct information or workflows.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>That means design is not independent</h2>
						<p>What this means is that design never stands alone. Your product needs to have an objective or purpose.</p>
						<br />
						<p>You can't get a design down unless you know your subject.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<quote>Content is King!</quote>
						<p><small>- All Professional Designers, if asked at any point in time.</small></p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>First Step!</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Get your content down</h2>
						<p>The first think you need to do get your main focus down</p>
						<p>After that, make a list of every feature you want your app to have</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>You don't have to be perfect</h2>
						<p>This is your brainstorming phase</p>
						<br />
						<p>Don't think about priority or feasibility at this moment. We will get to that part later.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Example</h2>
						<p>I want to make an application that displays neighborhood data on a mapped display.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>I want to see all the crimes against society.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the crimes against property.</li>
							<li>I want to see properties that are legally abandoned.</li>
							<li>I want to filter a neighborhoods addresses by their tax delinquency status.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the dangerous buildings in a neighborhood.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the problem renters in a neighborhood.</li>
							<li>I want to see the demographics information in a neighborhood.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Information Architecture</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Let's look at a normal dinner plate.</h2>
						<p>You have three sections on a typical dinner plate:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>1 Meat or Protein Item</li>
							<li>1 Grain</li>
							<li>Section of Fruits & Veggies</li>
						</ul>
						<p><small>I know there are exceptions such as chicken stir fry where all is masked together, but that's the keyword (exceptions)</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why the Separation?</h2>
						<p>Humans can only digest so much at one time</p>
						<p>Putting everything scrambled on the page illogically will drop your user retention rate.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How this applies to you</h2>
						<p>Now that you have your feature list, you need to group the features together in a way that makes sense for your user base.</p>
						<br />
						<p>This will essentially form what is known as the Information Architecture of your application - Logical grouping of features</p>
						<br />
						<p>This will greatly assist with navigation.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How to implement it.</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Write every feature on a flash card.</li>
							<li>Group features that belong together, or sound like they belong together.</li>
							<li>Once you have enough cards, give your group a one or two word name. If your have a name longer than this, your group is too broad.</li>
							<li>Keep repeating until all of your cards are grouped.</li>
							<li>For any ungroupable cards, reevaluate that feature to see if it fits in your app.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Example: Let's go back to the Neighborhood App.</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>I want to see all the crimes against society.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the crimes against property.</li>
							<li>I want to filter a neighborhoods addresses by their tax delinquency status.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the dangerous buildings in a neighborhood as a vacant indicator.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the problem renters in a neighborhood as a vacant indicator</li>
							<li>I want to see the demographics information in a neighborhood.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Crime</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>I want to see all the crimes against society.</li>
							<li>I want to see all the crimes against property.</li>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>Users will associated stuff together as being related.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Scattering items like nav all over the place makes it difficult to find what you need.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Likewise, stuff combined confuses the user as to what will occur.</p>

						<h1>Hierarchy Time</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Hierarchy Objective</h2>
						<p>Now that you know the content of your sections, you need to outline the flow of the page so that the most important content is emphasized the most.</p>
						<p>Rules of CRAP apply here, even though we do not have a visual display</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Crime Section Outline</h2>
						<p>Let's look at how we would create an outline for the Crime Page</p>

						<h1>Layouts</h1>

					<section>
						<h2>Laying out the page</h2>
						<p>Now that you have outlined your content, it's time to arrange it in a way that enhances your hierarchy.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Gridding is a great way to do this.</p>

						<h1>Typography</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Guidelines</h2>
						<p>Font is something that you can stick with and be safe, or go for something big and do something dangerous with it.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Font won't make the largest different in your site unless you make real bad decisions.</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>San Serif Font</h2>
						<img src="img/san_serif_example.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Typography Techniques</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><b>Bold</b>, <em>Italics</em>, and <u>Underline</u> are ways to emphasize text in your app</p>
						<p>Note that Italics can be hard to see, as well as bold for various fonts and screen resolutions</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Font By Size</h1>
						<h2>Good Contrast</h2>
						<p>Just by resizing fonts!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>To accomplish this, find a good base height (12px), and multiply it by 1.5 for every header you are looking to have.</p>
						<p>Ex: 12px body text, 18px sub header, and 27px for larger headers.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Color</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>Colors have different purposes, so it's more than just a matter of personal preferences.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/warm_colors.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/cool_colors.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/neutral_colors.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In addition to these basic principles, different countries and cultures have established meaning.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/international_colors.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Recommendation</h2>
						<p>Start with a base color. After you have established that, look online for color schemes related to that.</p>
						<br />
						<p>If that doesn't work for you, I recommend going to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/">Adobe Color.</a></p>
						<br />
						<p>Finally, black and white are good neutral colors that work everywhere!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Caveats</h2>
						<p>The W3C has recommendations for making your site accessible in terms of different between background and foreground color</p>
						<br />
						<p>Make sure that the colors you choose work well with the W3C color differences. Several online checkers can assist with this.</p>

						<h1>Where to go from here</h1>

					<section>
						<p>Remember the 4 principles of Design</p>
